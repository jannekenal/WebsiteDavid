									<h2><center>About ME!</center></h2>
								</header>
								<div class="center-justified"><p><center><br>Well, where do I begin? To be very honest, 
<br>I am extremely uncomfortable writing about myself. 
<br>I have decided, therefore, to post the following disclaimer in order to make myself feel better.
<br>
<br>*This brief autobiography is not fiction. Nevertheless, any similarity to real life persons or events, though not coincidental; may be construed as such by the reader.
<br>
<br>
<br>My life's journey (outside the womb) began on September 22nd, 1951.
<br>I should have known things would go off course, as for the next several decades I celebrated my birthday on September 21st.
<br> If I had only checked the calendar in the delivery room! 
<br>Don't ask me how it happened, because I don't know. 
<br>At age 56, I had to travel to my hometown, Mansfield, Ohio, and get a copy of my birth certificate.and there it was.. September 22nd. 
<br>
<br>Things seemed to be fairly good as I grew. 3 siblings, and I was clearly the brightest. 
<br>We moved around a lot, but always in the general area in or around Mansfield. 
<br>At age 8 I was made aware of just how special I was, when my parents bought me an extra set of eyes. Hindsight is 2020, you know? 
<br>I thought being called "four eyes" by my schoolmates was an honor, and issued many a thank you. I have since rescinded them.
<br>
<br>I spent many summer weeks at my Aunt Lu Lu's farm out near the local airport. 
<br>Loved it out there! Of course, there were a few problems. 
<br>I would usually come home covered from head to toe in poison ivy. I did become a terrific tree climber; thanks in part to my aunt's very mean Rhode Island red rooster. 
<br>I dearly loved her, but  failed to see the humor in being chased up a tree by that awful chicken! 
<br>
<br>The summer of 1963 we moved to Cleveland, where I attended and graduated from Lincoln High School, in 1969. 
<br>While spending a week on the farm at age 16, I met my first love, Becky. After getting back to Cleveland, we began exchanging letters. 
<br>You know the kind; handwritten on paper, stuffed in an envelope and mailed with a postage stamp? 
<br>Funny, though; after a few exchanges, she somehow got me mixed up with someone named "John", and I never heard from her again.
<br>
<br>
<br>Although pretty introverted, my self confidence began to soar through my last 3 years of high school. 
<br>I had matured into a "poster boy" for those old Charles Atlas bodybuilding ads found in the back of comic books. 
<br>Of course, at 98 pounds, I was the "before" photo. 
<br>I recall with fondness my select status among my gym classmates. 
<br>When team captains were selecting the rest of us for their squads, I held tight to the old adage, "they saved the best for last". 
<br>Further, when playing softball, I was always positioned in a special place referred to as "ultra" right field! 
<br>It was an honor to protect the vehicles in the school parking lot from damage, if anyone happened to blast a 900 foot homer.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>To sum up, then, I graduated with a sterling 2.44 GPA, and began pursuing a bigtime career.umm, sweeping floors and taking out trash at a steel plant. 
<br>I bounced around some, eventually settling in at a small business that made industrial quality cabinets, benches and material handling equipment. 
<br>Funny, it has been a far cry from the career choice recommended for me by school staff- becoming a writer (Yes, I know; if you have read this far, you are probably glad I ignored that advice). 
<br>Now I will take a few moments to fill you in on my "religious" background. 
<br>This is, after all, a  Christian website. 
<br>My early youth was spent in a Pentecostal church, as my great aunt and uncle were ministers in the Assemblies of God denomination. 
<br>So, I was exposed to some "tongues speaking" and other interesting manifestations of the "gifts of the Spirit". 
<br>But honestly, when you are between age 4 and 8, that stuff comes across as scary, and a little nuts! Between age 9, and my late teens I attended the Salvation Army, first in Mansfield, then in Cleveland, after we moved. 
<br>By the time I graduated high school, I had left "church" completely. The most important thing to note here is.although both denominations preached the gospel of Christ, I never did get saved.
<br>
<br>
<br>Ok then, July 14th, 1985. 
<br>At this point in time, I had been married, and divorced after 4 years. 
<br>I was the single parent of my 9 year old daughter, Adrienne. Now, July 14th was a beautiful, warm Sunday, and I had been invited to Westside Independent Baptist Church. 
<br>Though  I had no interest in attending, that day was the church picnic, and I was persuaded to bring Adrienne; at least she could have an afternoon of fun at the Metroparks. 
<br>Long story short; the pastor preached, I fell under the conviction of the Holy Spirit, and asked Jesus to be my Lord and Savior. 
<br>The most important moment of my life! I was baptized 2 weeks later, and joined the church. 
<br>Adrienne was  saved as well, after a few months.
<br>  
<br>
<br>The rest, as they say, is history. 
<br>I gradually became more involved in church activities, like driving the church van. 
<br>In 1990, I began studies at the Heritage Baptist Institute, a ministry of the Cleveland Baptist Church. 
<br>I graduated in 1993. Keep in mind, this was a small, unaccredited program, but thoroughly Bible based. 
<br>At any given time the entire student body might total 50 to 75 students. 
<br>So, depending on your point of view, I  graduated either first in my class, or third from the bottom, since there were just 3 of us. 
<br>I prefer the former.
<br>God has never called me to be an evangelist, missionary or pastor, though I have preached many times over the years as opportunity and need arose. 
<br>I was "drafted" into the congregational song leader position at Westside when the pastor discovered I had a nice "bucket" to carry a tune in (that bucket has long since rusted out at the bottom).but my first love, 
and I believe my calling, is teaching the Bible.
<br> So, here I am, with a website, a blog, and hopefully, my first of several published works.  
<br>I thank the reader for slogging through this page, and ".enduring to the end." 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>*Footnote: Yes, it is true. I have appropriated a bit of "creative license" while writing this autobiography. 
<br>I felt it imperative to try and keep the reader awake beyond the second paragraph. 
<br>The substance of my story is true, and that's all you need to know.
<br>If you are offended, feel free to send an exorcist my way. 
<br>However, I may need to crowdfund the payment, or risk being repossessed.
